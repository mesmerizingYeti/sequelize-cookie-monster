### Technologies  
> Express-React-Views, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, Sequelize, Heroku

Express-React-Views, HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript were used to create and design the front-end of the application.  
Node.js and Express.js were used for the server.  
I chose to use Sequelize for managing my MySQL database.
I used Heroku to deploy my application.
